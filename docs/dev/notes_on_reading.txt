ยง 2.4 Tridiagonal and Band Diagonal Systems of Equations
=======================================================
74
routine: tridag (code on page 75)

Naturally, one does not reserve storage for the full N x N matrix,
but only for the nonzero components, stored as three vectors

Band Diagonal Systems
---------------------
76
The geralized case for tridags

This is for when there's a tridag + some other regularly spaced
data (i.e., like with our heat diffusion equations)

banbks
	Once the matrix A has been decomposed, any number of right-hand
	sides can be solved in turn by repeated calls to banbks
	(backsubsitution)



ยง 2.7 Sparse Linear Systems
===========================
Cyclic Tridiagonal Systems
--------------------------
	Sherman-Morrison formula
		You compute A' from A and then want to make a small change to A but don't want to 
		have to completely recalculate A'.
