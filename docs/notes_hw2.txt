Develop 3D heat diffusion solver in C/C++

1
	- Create a program that can solve heat diffusion
	- 3 dimensions

	* Have program set up arbitrary Cartesian domain

	* Do not assume that the physical domain is cubic
			> can specify x, y, z values for shape of space

	* Do not assume that the partitioning is symmetric
			> can specify dx, dy, dz independently
